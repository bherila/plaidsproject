                Gavin has a master’s degree in social anthropology from Harvard
                University and a master’s in public health from Brown
                University. Gavin has research interests in infectious disease
                epidemiology, global health, and the study of HIV epidemiology
                among Asian populations, MSM, and trans populations. Gavin has
                research experience in cultural anthropology, qualitative
                methods, behavioral endocrinology, endocrinology, and
                epidemiology and has published in peer reviewed medical and
                public health journals. Gavin has done extensive volunteer work
                among HIV positive patients at Fenway Health, a community health
                center in Boston. Currently, Gavin is interested in reducing
                health disparities among Asian American MSM and other minorities
                and is currently working on a qualitative research project with
                Professor Don Operario at Brown University. This project seeks
                to examine the complex relationship between drug use, sexuality,
                and HIV transmission among Asian American MSM in San Francisco.
                Gavin is also interested in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV
                (PrEP), an antiretroviral drug that is being tested in high-risk
                MSM to prevent HIV acquisition.

                from Brown University. He has trained his financial and

                division of Standard Chartered First Bank. Han’s passion in
                social services started as early as in 2005, when he went to
                Philippines on a medical mission to provide health assistance to
                villagers of Tacloban. Since then, his primary interest in
                social services has been related to education. During his high
                school years at Phillips Exeter Academy, Han served as the Board
                Coordinator of Exeter Social Service Organization (ESSO) for
                educational outreach programs. In the recent years at Brown, he
                has found vision in social enterprises as powerful tools for
                creating necessary social changes. His belief in had led him to
                run a social enterprise in the past summer to address Korea’s
                high reliance on private tutoring institutions giving rise to
                inequality in educational level and available opportunities
                among youth.
